# Exofall design notes

## Locked (2026-11-09)
- 1.21.1 NeoForge, MIT, modid `exofall`
- Start small: **one complete meteor type per version**, then add more
- Meteors are about **50% buried in terrain** (not water), with a crater ring
- Crust needs a new pickaxe (nether stars, echo shards, netherite ingots, ...). Crust must be blast-proof and sealed
- Gear starts around Netherite, tuned against Sovereign 202's late game (Astral Sorcery, Ars Nouveau, Gaia legendaries, Better Nether flaming ruby, Lycanites). Multipliers in config
- Legendary weapons are standalone items (not BMM/BHB)
- In S202: introduced late Act 3 or in Act 4
- Bio-themed fantasy, no tech or guns. Mostly self-contained in the meteors
- Erebus is inspiration only: no code, assets, Erebus-specific names or mob concepts

## Long-term scope (aspirational)
25-40 mobs, 3 stone types, 5-7 meteor biomes, 6 woods, 30+ plants, 10 sub-structures,
~1 meteor per 850 blocks, 9-12 legendary weapons, 3 general materials, legendary armour sets,
at least 1 boss per meteor type, dungeon-like design, 5x5 crafting table.

## MVP (0.1): one meteor
1 stone type, 1 wood, ~6 plants, 5-6 mobs + 1 boss, 2 sub-structures, crust-breaker pickaxe,
5x5 table, 2 legendaries, 1 armour set.

## Step 1: technical prototype (no art)
A plain stone sphere that spawns half-buried, with a placeholder interior biome (own fog + one test plant).
- Meteor = custom Structure type. Sample ground height over the footprint, sink to the median, carve the shell
  in chunk-local pieces (like ocean monuments / strongholds), then place NBT sub-structures inside.
- Interior biome = real biome. Structure starts are known before the BIOMES step, so a hook there returns the
  meteor biome for 4x4x4 cells inside the interior (3D biomes, like Lush Caves under surface biomes).
  Gives fog/sky/music/particles, natural spawns, F3 name, and floor/ceiling plant decoration via `environment_scan`.
- Risks to prove: (1) meteor biomes must be added to the dimension's possible-biomes list or their features
  are dropped/crash at decoration; (2) compatibility with S202 biome-injection mods hooking the same step.
- Fallback: structure `spawn_overrides` + client-side "inside a meteor" check for fog/sky/music.

## Open questions
- Theme of the first meteor
- Locator item for finding a specific meteor type (1 per 850 blocks split across 5-7 types is a long hunt)
- Ways past the crust to block: TNT, creepers, ender pearls, chorus fruit, mods in S202
